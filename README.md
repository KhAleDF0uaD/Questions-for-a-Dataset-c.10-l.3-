Let's use pandas to take a look at the data! Run the cells in the Jupyter Notebook below. What are good questions you can ask based on this information? (There is more information about the columns in the dataset below the Jupyter Notebook.)
Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset from UCI Machine Learning Lab
(The dataset is included in the workspace here for you as "cancer_data.csv." If you're interested, you can explore it further here, on Kaggle.)
Attribute Information:
1.	ID number 
2.	Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign) 
3.	30 features 
The following ten features are computed for each cell nucleus. For each of these ten features, a column is created for the mean, standard error, and max value.
Feature	Description
Radius	Mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter
Texture	Standard deviation of gray-scale values
Perimeter	
Area	
Smoothness	Local variation in radius lengths
Compactness	Perimeter2 / Area - 1.0
Concavity	Severity of concave portions of the contour
Concave Points	Number of concave portions of the contour
Symmetry	
Fractal Dimension	"Coastline approximation" - 1
